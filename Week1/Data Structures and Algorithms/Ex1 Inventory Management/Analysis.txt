This inventory management system uses a HashMap<Integer, Product> to efficiently manage products by their productId. The primary operations supported are:

1. Add Product
Checks for product existence using containsKey()

If not present, adds the product using put()

2. Update Product
Looks up product by productId and modifies its fields

If not found, a message is shown

3. Delete Product
Removes the product using remove(productId)

Checks existence and removes only if present

4. Display Inventory
Iterates over the values() of the HashMap to display all products

Data Structure Used: HashMap
Key: productId (Integer)

Value: Product object

Why: Provides fast lookup, update, and delete by key (O(1) average time)

Advantages
Efficient for large-scale data

No need to scan all entries for updates/deletes

Easily extendable for sorting, file operations, etc.
